Inheritance is the capabilty of a class to derive its properties and characteristics from another class.


some benefits of inheritances are:
* Frequent use of code written once, i.e. code reusability.
* One superclass can be used for the number of subclasses in a hierarchy.
* No changes to be done in all base classes; just do changes in parent class only.
* Inheritance is used to generate more dominant objects.
* Inheritance avoids duplicity and data redundancy.
* Inheritance is used to avoid space complexity and time complex

an example of inheritance is:
sing System;
 
// single inheritance
class Animal {
    public void Eat() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}
 
class Dog : Animal {
    public void Bark() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
