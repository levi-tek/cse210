Encapsulation is the process of securing your code just like putting it in a capsule to restrict other code from havng acces to it.

Some benefit of encapsulatio can be found below:
* it enhances security: Hiding the internal state of objects prevents unauthorized access and manipulation

*it creates easy adaptation: Encapsulation makes it easier for designers to make changes to the code without risking compatibility. This facilitates successful code evolution over time. 

*it creates easier maintenance: You can develop, test, and debug encapsulated objects independently. Encapsulation can be especially useful in maintaining large data sets.


An example of encapsulation is:
public class Reference
{
    //Private class inside the propieties to not affect the working of the program
    private string _book;
    private string _chapter;
    private string _verse;

    private string _verse2;
